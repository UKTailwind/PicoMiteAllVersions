commands and functions
 each function is responsible for decoding a command
 all function names are in the form cmd_xxxx() (for a basic command) or fun_xxxx() (for a basic function) so, if you want to search for the
 function responsible for the NAME command look for cmd_name

 There are 4 items of information that are setup before the command is run.
 All these are globals.

 int cmdtoken	This is the token number of the command (some commands can handle multiple
				statement types and this helps them differentiate)

 char *cmdline	This is the command line terminated with a zero char and trimmed of leading
				spaces.  It may exist anywhere in memory (or even ROM).

 char *nextstmt	This is a pointer to the next statement to be executed.  The only thing a
				command can do with it is save it or change it to some other location.

 char *CurrentLinePtr  This is read only and is set to NULL if the command is in immediate mode.

 The only actions a command can do to change the program flow is to change nextstmt or
 execute longjmp(mark, 1) if it wants to abort the program.
