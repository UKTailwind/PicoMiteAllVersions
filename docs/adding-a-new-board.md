# Adding a New Board

One-page guide to onboarding a new device target onto the real-HAL layout.

Prerequisites: read `docs/real-hal-plan.md` (the index) + `docs/real-hal/architecture.md` (directory layout) first. The standard is non-negotiable — see §"The standard" in the plan doc. This guide is the paved path; it assumes you accept it.

## The shape of a port

A port is a directory under `ports/<your_board>/` that supplies three files plus a selection in the top-level CMake recipe. Drivers are not written here — they live under `drivers/*/`, and your port selects which ones it links. If your board needs a peripheral no existing driver covers, see "New drivers" at the end.

### Required files

```
ports/<your_board>/
    port_config.h      — 20-odd #define constants (plain #defines, no #ifdef)
    pin_tables.c       — PINMAP[] + codemap(pin)
    port_defaults.c    — port_set_default_options() for factory reset
```

That's it. Copy the closest existing port (usually `ports/pico/` for RP2040 variants or `ports/pico_rp2350/` for RP2350), then change the values.

## Step 1 — port_config.h

All port-config macros have the `HAL_PORT_` prefix. They are **values**, not gates — core reads them inside C expressions and array sizes. Renaming a `#ifdef` to `#if HAL_PORT_FOO` is gaming the rule, not following it.

Start from `ports/pico/port_config.h` (the simplest). Key knobs, grouped:

- **Chip identity:** `HAL_PORT_PWM_SLICE_COUNT`, `HAL_PORT_GPIO_COUNT`, `HAL_PORT_PIO_COUNT`, `HAL_PORT_HAS_PIO2`, `HAL_PORT_HAS_FAST_TIMER`, `HAL_PORT_HAS_INT5`.
- **Chip features present:** `HAL_PORT_HAS_PSRAM`, `HAL_PORT_HAS_UPNG`, `HAL_PORT_HAS_DEFINES`, `HAL_PORT_HAS_MP3`.
- **Board features:** `HAL_PORT_HAS_HEARTBEAT`, `HAL_PORT_HAS_SSD1963`, `HAL_PORT_HAS_HDMI`, `HAL_PORT_HAS_NEXTGEN_DISPLAY`, `HAL_PORT_IS_VGA`.
- **Numeric caps:** `HAL_PORT_ADC_CHANNEL_MAX`, `HAL_PORT_FILES_MAX`, `HAL_PORT_AUDIO_FLAC_MAX_BASE_HZ`, `HAL_PORT_AUDIO_MOD_BUFFER_SIZE`.
- **Memory layout:** `HAL_PORT_FRAMEBUFFER_TRAILER_BYTES`, `HAL_PORT_ALLMEMORY_ALIGN`.
- **Flash-vs-RAM placement macros:** `HAL_PORT_RAM_FUNC`, `HAL_PORT_MMBASIC_HOT_FUNC`, `HAL_PORT_MMBASIC_SUBFUN_FUNC`. Expand to `__not_in_flash_func(name)` where RAM is available; plain `name` on RAM-constrained variants (rp2040 WEB, rp2040 VGA).
- **Per-board references:** `HAL_PORT_LCD_SPI_CLK_PIN` (which `Option.*` field carries the LCD SPI clock pin), `HAL_PORT_CONSOLE_FONT_MEDIUM` (symbol name for the medium console font).
- **Port hooks:** `HAL_PORT_RANDOMIZE_DEFAULT_SEED()`, `HAL_PORT_BC_CRASH_INFO_ATTR`.

If a macro doesn't apply to your board, define it to `0` (or the null form). The point is that every port defines every macro — core code reads unconditionally.

## Step 2 — pin_tables.c

**Background: `PinDef[]` and the two numbering systems.** MMBasic has two ways of naming a pin in user code: the physical *package pin number* (1, 2, 4, 5, … — what's silkscreened on the header), and the *GPIO number* (`GP0`, `GP1`, `GP2`, … — what the chip datasheet calls the line). BASIC syntax accepts either. Internally, everything goes through `PinDef[]` — an array indexed by package-pin number. Each entry carries `{pin, GPno, pinname, mode, ADCpin, slice}`: the chip's GPIO number, the printable label, a bitmask of supported modes (`DIGITAL_IN`, `PWM4A`, `I2C0SDA`, `SPI1SCK`, …), the ADC channel number if any, and the PWM slice number. `PinDef[]` itself lives in `PicoMite.c` today (relocation to `ports/` is tracked separately) — as a new-port author you're not redefining `PinDef[]`, you're supplying two smaller lookup tables that reference it.

**PINMAP** is the GPIO-number → package-pin-number map: `PINMAP[gpio]` gives the `PinDef[]` index for that GPIO. One entry per GPIO on your chip (30 on RP2040, 48 on RP2350). When a BASIC program writes `SETPIN GP0, DOUT`, the parser resolves `GP0` to GPIO 0, then the runtime calls `codemap(0)` → `PINMAP[0]` → the `PinDef[]` slot for whichever header pin GP0 is wired to.

**codemap** is the validated accessor:

```c
int codemap(int pin)
{
    if (pin > <HAL_PORT_GPIO_COUNT - 1> || pin < 0) error("Invalid GPIO");
    return (int)PINMAP[pin];
}
```

Bounds-check the GPIO, error if out of range, return the `PinDef[]` slot. The bound is your chip's GPIO count, not its package pin count.

**Worked example — `ports/pico/pin_tables.c`:**

```c
const uint8_t PINMAP[30] = {
     1,  2,  4,  5,  6,  7,  9, 10, 11, 12,   // GP0..GP9
    14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25,   // GP10..GP19
    26, 27, 29, 41, 42, 43, 31, 32, 34, 44    // GP20..GP29
};
```

Read line by line: GPIO 0 is on package pin 1, GPIO 1 is on package pin 2, GPIO 2 is on package pin 4 (pin 3 is GND, so the sequence skips it), and so on. The "skipped" numbers are the GND / VSYS / RUN / etc. pins on the board header.

**How to build PINMAP for a new board:**

1. Open `PicoMite.c` and find the `const struct s_PinDef PinDef[] = {...}` definition. Skim it — each entry's comment gives the package-pin number.
2. For GPIO 0, find the `PinDef[]` entry whose `GPno` field is 0. Its `pin` field is what goes in `PINMAP[0]`.
3. Repeat for every GPIO 0..`HAL_PORT_GPIO_COUNT - 1`.
4. If your board routes a GPIO to something other than a user header (e.g. onboard LED, QSPI to flash, CYW43 SDIO on PicoW), that GPIO still gets a `PinDef[]` slot — just one marked `UNUSED` or with a special label. It still needs a `PINMAP[]` entry pointing there.

**Why `codemap()` matters:** it's the single point of translation between GPIO-numbered BASIC syntax (`SETPIN GP0, DOUT`) and `PinDef[]`. If your `PINMAP` is wrong, every GPIO-numbered BASIC statement on that pin silently targets the wrong `PinDef[]` slot — the mode-mask check will refuse legal operations, the PWM slice will come back wrong, `PIN READ` will read a different line. There's no secondary cross-check; verify PINMAP against `PinDef[]` by hand before first boot.

**Pitfall to watch:** if you change `PinDef[]` to add a new pin entry for your board, the package-pin indices after the insertion point shift and every `PINMAP[]` entry that pointed past the insertion needs updating. Safer to append new `PinDef[]` entries at the end rather than inserting into the middle.

## Step 3 — port_defaults.c

One export:

```c
void port_set_default_options(void);
```

Called by `FileIO.c::ResetOptions()` after shared defaults. Set any `Option.*` field whose factory value differs from the shared default — typical: SSD_RESET, TOUCH_XSCALE, SerialTX/RX, KeyboardConfig, ColourCode.

Port impl files are **exempt from the purity gate** (the core/header rule only applies to files under `core/` and `hal/`). Target-macro `#ifdef` is fine here — that's where conditional bodies are supposed to live.

## Step 4 — wire into CMake

Top-level `CMakeLists.txt` (RP2040) or `CMakeLists 2350.txt` (RP2350) has big `if (COMPILE STREQUAL "<NAME>")` blocks. Add your target name to:

1. The include-path block (so `ports/<your_board>/port_config.h` is found).
2. The `add_executable` source list (add `ports/<your_board>/pin_tables.c` and `ports/<your_board>/port_defaults.c`).
3. The driver-selection blocks — add your target name to each `if (COMPILE STREQUAL ...)` that gates a driver you need (spi_lcd, vga_pio, hdmi, pwm_synth, sd_spi, etc.). See the existing branches for the pattern.
4. Any preprocessor-define blocks (`add_compile_definitions`) that set target macros your drivers expect (`PICOMITE`, `PICOMITEVGA`, `USBKEYBOARD`, etc.).

Finally add your target name to `buildall.sh` under `TARGETS=(...)`.

## Step 5 — acceptance

A port is done when **all** of these pass:

1. `tools/check_hal_purity.sh` is green (no regression in core/ or hal/).
2. `./host/run_tests.sh` is 239/239 passed + `HAL purity gate: clean`.
3. `./buildall.sh` builds every target including yours, clean.
4. Your target boots to the MMBasic prompt on real hardware.

If any of (1)–(3) regresses while adding your board, you've introduced an ifdef into core or violated the purity standard — fix that, don't exempt the file. Physical boot-up is the hardware-specific check the other three don't cover.

## New drivers

If your board needs a peripheral not already under `drivers/*/`, add it there — **not in your port directory**. Drivers are shared across ports; port directories are per-board recipes, not per-board code.

Rules for new drivers:

- One peripheral per driver.
- Driver depends on at most one MCU shim (`ports/pico_sdk_common/`).
- Driver may contain local target-macro `#ifdef` gates (e.g. rp2040-vs-rp2350 register differences).
- No cross-driver coupling.
- `HAL_PORT_RAM_FUNC` / `__not_in_flash_func` annotations honoured for hot paths.
- Ships with a `tests/` subdir if the peripheral admits an off-board conformance test.

## Two ground rules

1. **Don't add `#ifdef YOUR_BOARD` to core files.** The whole refactor exists to make that unnecessary. If you're tempted, stop — the answer is either a new port-config macro (if it's a value-shaped knob), a new port hook function (if it's a body-shaped divergence), or a new driver flavour (if it's a whole peripheral swap).

2. **Don't rename a `#ifdef rp2350` to `#if HAL_PORT_FOO`.** Per the fixup-plan standard, that's gaming, not eliminating. Core files must have zero preprocessor conditionals on any target-macro OR port-config macro. Port-config constants are values, not gates.
